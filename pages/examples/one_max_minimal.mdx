# A Taste of Keen: Minimal OneMax Example

In this section, you'll get a quick introduction to Keen by solving the **OneMax problem**—a classic optimization
problem in evolutionary computation—with minimal configuration. The goal of this problem is to evolve a binary string
where all bits are set to `true{:kotlin}` (or 1-bits).

This example demonstrates Keen's power and flexibility, showcasing how easy it is to define a genetic algorithm (GA)
with minimal setup.

> **Note**: The following example uses mostly default configurations. While it’s not optimized for performance, it
serves as a quick introduction. For a more detailed explanation of configurations, refer to the
[OneMax example](link-to-onemax).

## Problem Statement:
The **OneMax** problem aims to maximize the number of `true{:kotlin}` values (or 1-bits) in a binary string of fixed
length. The optimal solution is a string of all `true{:kotlin}` values, and the fitness function counts how many bits in
the string are `true{:kotlin}`.

## Implementation

Here's the minimal configuration for solving the OneMax problem in Keen:

```kotlin
// Fitness function: counts the number of 'true' values in the genotype
private fun count(genotype: Genotype<Boolean, BooleanGene>) = genotype.flatten().count { it }.toDouble()

// Main function to solve the OneMax problem with minimal configuration
suspend fun oneMaxMinimal() {
    Domain.toStringMode = ToStringMode.SIMPLE
    val engine = geneticAlgorithm(
        ::count, // Fitness function
        genotypeOf {
            chromosomeOf {
                booleans {
                    size = 50 // Binary string of length 50
                }
            }
        }
    ) {
        alterers += listOf(BitFlipMutator(), UniformCrossover()) // Mutation and crossover operators
        limits += TargetFitness(50.0) // Stop evolution once fitness reaches 50
        listeners += listOf(EvolutionSummary(), EvolutionPlotter()) // Evolution progress listeners
    }
    // Run the genetic algorithm
    engine.evolve()
    // Display summary of evolution
    engine.publicListeners.filterIsInstance<EvolutionSummary<*, *, *, *>>().first().display()
    // Display fitness progression plot
    engine.publicListeners.filterIsInstance<EvolutionPlotter<*, *, *, *>>().first().display()
}
```

### Code Breakdown:
- **Fitness Function (`count`)**: Counts the number of `true{:kotlin}` bits in the genotype, which is the binary string.
- **Genotype Configuration**: Defines a binary string of size 50 using `booleans { size = 50 }`.
- **Operators**: Two genetic operators, `BitFlipMutator` (mutation) and `UniformCrossover` (crossover), are applied to
    alter the population.
- **Stopping Condition**: The algorithm stops once the target fitness (50 `true` bits) is reached.
- **Listeners**: `EvolutionSummary` prints the summary, and `EvolutionPlotter` visualizes the fitness progress.

### Example Usage:

To run this example on different platforms, use the following:

```kotlin
// For JVM platforms:
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
fun main() = runBlocking {
    oneMaxMinimal()
}

// For JS platforms:
suspend fun main() {
    oneMaxMinimal()
}
```

### Expected Output:

After running the evolution process, the following should be displayed:
- **Evolution Summary**: A table or textual summary of the evolution process (e.g., generations, fitness values).
- **Fitness Plot**: A plot showing the progression of fitness over generations.

## Key Points:
- The example highlights the simplicity of Keen's genetic algorithm DSL.
- Default settings are used for ease of understanding, but Keen offers powerful customization options for more complex use cases.
- This code serves as a foundation for more advanced configurations and can be extended by modifying the mutation, crossover rates, or adding new constraints and operators.
